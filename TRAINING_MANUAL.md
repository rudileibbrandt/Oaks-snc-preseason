**Screen 8: Performers** (Coaches only)

This view shows consistent performers across all weeks:

- Helps coaches identify who needs extra support

> 📸 **Screenshot 16**: Performers view showing top and bottom 10

## Quick Tips

### ✅ Do This:
- **Log workouts immediately** after finishing - don't wait!
- **Be honest** - enter your actual numbers, not what you wish you did
- **Complete all exercises** before clicking "Finish Workout"
- **Check the Stat Board regularly** to see how you're doing
- **Watch the videos** - click exercise names to see proper form
- **Don't skip warm-ups** - they're mandatory for a reason!

### ❌ Don't Do This:
- Don't wait days to log - you'll forget the numbers
- Don't make up numbers to look better
- Don't skip exercises - partial workouts don't count as complete
- Don't try to log future weeks - it won't work
- Don't ignore the warm-up protocol

### 💡 Pro Tips:
- **Use the week navigation** to go back and log workouts you forgot
- **Check your completion rate** - aim for 80%+ (green)
- **Compare your "Best" values** week to week to see improvement
- **Ask your coach** if you're confused about anything
- **Watch exercise videos** before trying new exercises

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't log a workout for next week"

**Solution:** You can only log workouts for the current week or past weeks. This prevents accidentally logging future workouts. Use the week navigation to go back to the current week.

### "My workout isn't showing on the Stat Board"

**Possible causes:**
1. **You didn't click "Finish Workout"** - Make sure to click the button at the bottom
2. **You're looking at the wrong week** - Check the week selector
3. **The data is still saving** - Wait a moment and refresh the page

**Solution:** Go back to your workout, make sure all exercises have data, click "Finish Workout", then check the Stat Board again.

### "I entered the wrong numbers"

**Solution:** No problem! Just go back to that workout day and week, change the numbers, and click "Finish Workout" again. The app will update your data.

### "I can't see coaches on the Stat Board"

**This is normal!** The Stat Board only shows players. Coaches can see everyone, but players only see other players. This keeps the focus on athlete performance.

### "The input field loses focus when I type"

**Solution:** This should be fixed now! If it still happens:
- Make sure you're typing directly into the field
- Don't click away while typing
- Try refreshing the page

### "I forgot my password"

**Solution:**
- If you used Google/Microsoft, use their password reset
- If you used email/password, you'll need to contact your coach (password reset isn't built into the app yet)

### "The app is slow or not loading"

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the page (pull down on mobile, or F5 on desktop)
3. Try closing and reopening the app
4. Clear your browser cache if problems persist

### "I can't find a specific exercise"

**Solution:** Make sure you're looking at the right day. Each exercise is assigned to a specific day:
- **Day 1**: Deadlifts, Dips, Lat Pulldowns, Ab Roll Out, Back Extension
- **Day 2**: Split Squat Jump, Split Squat Hold, Bench Press, Seated Row
- **Day 3**: Squat, Hang Cleans & Press, Bear Crawls, Wall Sits
- **Day 4**: Sprints only

### "I want to change my position"

**Solution:**
1. Go to "MY WORKOUTS"
2. Click the "Update Position" button in the top right
3. Select your new position (Forward or Back)
4. Click "Save"
