- **Green diamond** = All exercises completed for that day
- **Amber diamond** = Some exercises completed (partial)
- **Empty** = No exercises completed

Players are sorted by completion rate (highest first).

### Understanding Your Ranking

When you click on a "Best" value, you'll see:

- **Percentile Groups**: After top 10, players are grouped by percentiles
  - Top 25%
  - Top 50%
  - Top 75%
  - Bottom 25%

Your ranking is shown in brackets next to your number (e.g., "225lbs (#5)").

### Completion Rate

Each player has a completion percentage shown:

## Understanding Your Progress

### Personal Bests

Your "Best" values show:
- The highest weight you've lifted for each exercise (across all weeks)
- Your fastest sprint time (across all weeks)
- These are all-time bests, not just this week!

### Workout Completion

The completion view helps you see:
- Which days you've completed
- Which days you still need to do
- How consistent you are week-to-week

### Comparing to Teammates

Remember:
- The Stat Board shows all players (not coaches)
- You can see how you rank against your teammates
- Use it as motivation, not pressure!

## Tips for Success

### 1. Log Workouts Immediately

**Don't wait!** Log your workout right after you finish it. You'll forget the exact numbers if you wait.

### 2. Be Honest

Enter your actual numbers - not what you wish you did. The app is for tracking real progress, not impressing others.

### 3. Complete All Exercises

Make sure to enter data for ALL exercises in a workout before clicking "Finish Workout". Partial workouts don't count as complete.

### 4. Check the Stat Board Regularly

See how you're doing compared to your teammates. Use it as motivation to stay consistent!

### 5. Watch the Videos

Click on exercise names to see video demonstrations. Proper form is more important than heavy weight!

### 6. Don't Skip Warm-Ups

The warm-up protocol is mandatory for a reason. It prevents injuries and prepares your body for the workout.

### 7. Log Past Weeks

If you forgot to log a workout, you can go back to previous weeks and add it. Just use the week navigation!

### 8. Ask for Help

If you're confused about:
- How to do an exercise → Watch the video or ask your coach
- How to use the app → Ask a teammate or coach
- What numbers to enter → Ask your coach

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't log a workout for next week"

**Solution**: You can only log workouts for the current week or past weeks. This prevents accidentally logging future workouts.

### "My workout isn't showing on the Stat Board"

**Possible causes:**
1. You didn't click "Finish Workout" - make sure to click the button at the bottom
2. You're looking at the wrong week - check the week selector
3. The data is still saving - wait a moment and refresh

### "I entered the wrong numbers"

**Solution**: You can go back and update your workout. Just navigate to that week and day, and change the numbers. The app will save your changes automatically.

### "I can't see coaches on the Stat Board"

**This is normal!** The Stat Board only shows players. Coaches can see everyone, but players only see other players.

### "I forgot my password"

**Solution**: 
- If you used Google/Microsoft, use their password reset
- If you used email, use the "Forgot Password" link on the login screen

### "The app is slow or not loading"

**Solutions:**
1. Check your internet connection
2. Refresh the page
3. Try closing and reopening the app
4. Clear your browser cache if problems persist

### "I can't find a specific exercise"

**Solution**: Make sure you're looking at the right day. Each exercise is assigned to a specific day:
- Day 1: Deadlifts, Dips, Lat Pulldowns, etc.
- Day 2: Split Squats, Bench Press, Rows, etc.
- Day 3: Squats, Cleans, Bear Crawls, etc.
- Day 4: Sprints only

## Final Thoughts

This app is designed to help you:
- ✅ Track your progress
- ✅ Stay accountable
- ✅ Compete with your teammates (in a healthy way!)
- ✅ See your improvement over time

Remember: **Consistency beats intensity**. It's better to complete all your workouts at moderate intensity than to go all-out once and skip the rest.

**Good luck, and train hard!** 💪
